This project was part of Web Applicaiton Development intermediate course, was a team effort and focused on developing a database driven web application incorporating MVC patterns. Utilized technologies and concepts included state maintenance, CRUD, & REST integration on both server & client side, REACT JS, testing with Jasmine and Postman,
Javascript / ECMAScript, parsing JSON and integrating API data.

The project is a system of web applications to manage online ordering from hot dog carts with separate interfaces for hotdog vendors, customers and back end administrators.
It focused on following considerations: 

- Customers should be able to view a map that shows all current hot dog cart locations. 

- Customers should be able to select a cart from the map, view detailed information about that cart, and place online orders to that cart.

- Hot Dog Vendors should be able to see incoming orders on a tablet display at their cart.

- Hot Dog Vendors should be able to mark menu items as unavailable and orders for unavailable items at that location are blocked.

- Hot Dog Vendors should be able to update their location and availability, so their cart location is accurately reflected on the cart map.

- System Admins should be able to add new carts to the system.

- System Admins should be able to update menus.

- System Admins should be able to view logs of customer, vendor, and admin system actions.

- All System Users should be able to view the apps on a desktop, tablet, or mobile browser.
